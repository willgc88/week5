    /** Reads in the NumberTriangle structure from a file.
     *
     * You may assume that it is a valid format with a height of at least 1,
     * so there is at least one line with a number on it to start the file.
     *
     * See input_tree.txt for an example NumberTriangle format.
     *
     * The first row is the root of the NumberTriangle (call it 0).
     * The second line contains the two children of the root (call them 1L and 1R).
     * The third line contains the three numbers corresponding to:
     *      - the left child of 1L, call it (2LL)
     *      - the right child of 1L, call it (2LR)
     *      - the left child of 1R, call it (2RL)
     *      - the right child of 1R, call it (2RR)
     *   NOTE: 2RL and 2LR will correspond to the same underlying NumberTriangle object.
     *
     *   Hint 0: Start by making a plan and scaffolding what you plan to do; if you
     *           are still finding it hard to "think in Java", write some comments describing
     *           what you want to do or try implementing some of the logic in Python.
     *
     *   Hint 1: Base your file reading code off what was shown in lecture last
     *           week for reading a csv file line by line and splitting strings.
     *
     *   Hint 2: Think about what you need to keep track of on each iteration of the loop and
     *           make appropriate variables to store those things.
     *
     *   Hint 3: Related to 2, think about how to connect NumberTriangle objects between layers in the
     *           structure.
     *
     *   Hint 4: If you are still stuck, it might help to think of a sub problem you can solve,
     *           then design the logic of your solution around that helper, which you can
     *           implement separately. This kind of decomposition of a problem can make it much
     *           more manageable.
